## üíñ Making Something?
-  [PartCad](https://partcad.org/) [github](https://github.com/partcad) Supports OpenSCAD and linking to +CadQuery +build123d. Supports Assemblies of OpenSCAD and others via YAML.  Has a VsCode Plugin & integrates with OCP Viewer. Multi-model AI LLM genration. Integrates with KiCad and others. Exports to Everything (SVG, PNG, STEP, BREP, STL, 3MF, ThreeJS, & OBJ).  Active Developer. If you're wondering how to take OpenSCAD to the next level please show PartCad your love!! Start designing modular hardware! PartCAD is the standard for documenting manufacturable physical products. ü§Ø
